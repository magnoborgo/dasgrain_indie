Tested to work with DasGrain 1.8

## Instalation

Just drop the files on your .nuke Toolset folder. I've included a sample Voronoi map and the Voronoi map generator (regular Nuke only).<br>
** YOU NEED A SEQUENCE OF ANIMATED VORONOI MAPS ** otherwise your resampled grain will be static.


Voronoi map alternatives:

## Thanks

Thanks and kudos to Fabian Holtz (the creator of Dasgrain), <br>
this is just some code adaptation to make it run within the limitations of Indie/Non-commercial.
